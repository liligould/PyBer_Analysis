# PyBer_Analysis

## Purpose
With the help of graphic applications through Pandas  and matplotlib, visualizations of rideshare data via city type were created in order to help improve access to PyBerâ€™s ride-sharing services by determining whether average fare and total rides per city type are correlated. By creating multiple DataFrames ride sharing data such as total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per rider and driver and total fare by city type will also help determine affordable prices for underserved neighborhoods.

## Findings

The first steps that were taken was to determine total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per rider and driver and total fare per city type (Rural, Suburban, Urban). Based on the information gathered urban locations have the advantage for accessibility, and affordability due to having higher populations in general. A higher population means more riders, more drivers, and lower costs due to high demand. Urban areas have 13 times more riders than rural locations and 30 times more drivers. Although drivers do make 3 times more per fare when driving in rural areas, overall total fares is 9 times higher in urban locations. While drivers make a lot for individual rides in rural locations riders have to pay more than urban riders.

## Summary
In summary, higher populations per location allow for more accessibility and affordability to ride share services. While urban areas tend to have denser populations per square mile then suburban and rural it makes sense why there are 30 times more drivers, 13 times more riders, and lower fares for riders. It also makes sense why drivers make more in urban and suburban areas because the demand for ride shares is frequent versus rural areas. In order to reach these rural areas:

* First recommendation is to gather more information such as population density, age demographics, and even number of licensed drivers to determine if market penetration is possible and profitable for ride shares. 

* Another recommendation would be to offer promotions, and coupons for both riders and drivers in rural locations to make the drive and cost worth their while.

* A third recommendation could be to just not bother with rural locations at all due to low populations in general and to focus solely on expanding into Suburban neighborhoods. It seems more possible to add more drivers to suburban locations and to create a need for riders then to add drivers to low population areas.
